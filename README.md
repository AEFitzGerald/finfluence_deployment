This is a Full-Stack MERN project. As the lead developer and designer my goal was to build a digital asset dashboard within a weeks time- the concept was to make a financial site, where users could explore digital asset trading and discuss different values of blockchain projects, with a focus on a blockchain project's impact, for social and environmental good.

Using the MERN stack, I incorporated CoinGecko's API data, and mapped the data into cryptocurrency stat cards, and I used Chart.js' JavaScript library to make a dynamic infographic. I built out a User schema in MongoDB with a bcrypt registration and login.

For a dashboard feature, I styled a world map using Mapbox Studio, and created a functional React map component. Eventually, I would like to build custom markers on the map to distinguish blockchain project locations.

I pushed my working-knowledge of MongoDB and Mongoose further by creating a 1:N database schema for the Question and Answer feature of the app. In the frontend, for the QA feature, I still need to add other CRUD capabilities, while the API routes and backend are ready to go. The idea is to have questions and answers like sticky notes.

I am very interested in creating functional, intriguing, and easy to read, data analytics. My favorite part of this project was building the dynamic infographic with Chart.js.
