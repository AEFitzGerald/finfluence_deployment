Deployed with AWS Cloud Service http://3.22.233.93/

This is a MERN project, a work in progress, an exploration of building a Digital Asset Dashboard. My goal was to incorporate cryptocurrency API data, 
and deliver it to the client with a friendly user interface, in the quest to build a personalized social-FIN hub. 

Using CoinGecko API, I created stat cards with a selection of crypto financial data, and funneled some of the API data into an infographic,
making use of the Chart.js library. 

For a dashboard feature, I styled an on-brand world map using Mapbox API, and layed it into the landing page and dashboard of the app. Eventually, 
I would like to build out custom markers on the map of blockchain projects happening around the world. 

I pushed my working-knowledge of Mongodb and Mongoose further by creating a 1:N database schema for the Question and Answer feature of the app.  Right now, users can input
questions, retrieve that quesiton, add an answer to the question, and retrieve all the answers to the question. I have full CRUD routes built out for this in the backend, and 
still need to implement the client-Update frontend controls for this. 

Overall there were a lot of pieces in this project that were satisfying to implement and make functional-- 
the Bcypt Login/Registration, accessing the API financial data, and using Chart.js. 

I am very interested in creating functional, intriguing, and easy to read data analytics. My favorite part of this project was building out the code for the PieChart.
